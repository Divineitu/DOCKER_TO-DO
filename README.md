Documentation: Building an Online Application for a To-Do List

1. Executing the Program Locally:
Use these instructions to launch the TO-DO list program locally:
Save the HTML file that is delivered to your local computer after downloading it.
Open the HTML file with a web browser (such as Firefox or Chrome).
Your web browser will launch the TO-DO list application, allowing you to add things right away.

3. Building a Container and Launching a Docker Image:
Here's how to use a Docker container to run the TO-DO list application if that's more your style:
In the same directory as the HTML file, create a Dockerfile.
Transfer the HTML file's contents to the Dockerfile.
Use the following command to create the Docker image:
Todo-list-app: Copy code; docker build -t.
After the pictureOnce constructed, you may use the following command to launch a container:
Arduino
Copy code: docker run todo-list-app -d -p 8080:80
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the TO-DO list application.

3. Decisions and Assumptions:
A number of presumptions and choices were made during the development phase in order to improve the TO-DO list application's aesthetics and user experience:
Unusual Styling: To provide an interesting user interface, the application was stylized with a distinctive color scheme, custom typefaces, and a modern layout.
Custom Checkbox Design: To enhance the task completion feature's usefulness and visual appeal, a custom checkbox design was put into place.
The program was made with responsive design in mind, guaranteeing a smooth user experience on a range of screens and devices.
Layout in Minimalism: The In order to maximize usability and simplicity for users handling their chores, the layout was kept simple.
No Backend Logic: Since this is a front-end-only program, neither data persistence nor backend logic have been included. Local storage for tasks is provided via the browser's memory.
Accessibility: By adhering to online accessibility best practices, an attempt was made to guarantee that the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
By following these instructions, users can effectively manage their chores with an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface by running the TO-DO list application locally or within a Docker container.
